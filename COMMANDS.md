```

**Lifter Characteristics:**
- **Speed**: LIFT_SPEED (50 RPM default)
- **Motor**: Dedicated lifter motor (Motor 1)
- **Independence**: Separate from omni wheel control
- **Safety**: Hardware limit switches prevent over-travel

**Limit Switch Safety:**

**Compact Safety Codes:**
See `LOGGING_CODES.md` for complete documentation of all compact codes used by the system.

**Movement Logic:**
- When at TOP limit: Can only move DOWN (away from limit)
- When at BOTTOM limit: Can only move UP (away from limit)
- When not at limits: Can move in both directions

## Raspberry Pi Integration Examples

### Python Serial Control
```python
import serial
import time

# Connect to Arduino
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200, timeout=1)

# Basic movement
ser.write(b'f')  # Forward
time.sleep(2)
ser.write(b's')  # Stop

# Servo control
ser.write(b'mc')  # Center tilt servo
time.sleep(0.5)
ser.write(b'nc')  # Close gripper
time.sleep(0.5)

# Sensor monitoring
ser.write(b'sr')  # Get sensor readings
response = ser.readline().decode()
```

### Simple Movement Sequences
```python
def move_forward(distance_seconds):
    ser.write(b'f')
    time.sleep(distance_seconds)
    ser.write(b's')

def rotate_90_clockwise():
    ser.write(b'c')
    time.sleep(1.5)  # Adjust timing for 90° rotation
    ser.write(b's')

# Figure-8 pattern
def figure_eight():
    ser.write(b'g')  # Start figure-8 pattern
    time.sleep(10)   # Run for 10 seconds
    ser.write(b's')  # Stop
```

### Sensor-Based Navigation
```python
def avoid_obstacle():
    ser.write(b'sr')  # Get sensor readings
    # Parse ultrasonic readings
    if front_distance < 30:  # cm
        ser.write(b'b')  # Backup
        time.sleep(1)
        ser.write(b'c')  # Turn
        time.sleep(0.5)
        ser.write(b's')
